This is a project for finding targeted american stocks for investment. Multiprocessing technique was used to efficiently process as much as possible (default of 4) potential stocks.\n
All the processed stocks' information were then stored as an excel file, with information such as current stock price, value of MA20, and the difference ratio between those two values aforementioned.\n
Basic filtering function built in excel software was then applied to filter out targeted stocks for further investment.
